# Gmail launcher MIDlet

I have the new Nokia 3310 3G. Although the app store has a [Mail app](http://ovi.sigma.apps.bemobi.com/en_us/mail_mailnokiaall.html) that supports SMTP and POP or IMAP, it does not have the features Gmail users expect. Also, there is a native [Gmail app](http://boostapps.com/apps/gmail-2-0-6), but the Google endpoint to support this app is no longer maintained. Fortunately, Gmail's mweb UI (except for contacts) works on the Nokia's OperaMini browser.

I created this Gmail launcher MIDlet because opening Gmail from an OperaMini bookmark was annoying.

Here are the files: [JAD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/woodie/gmail/master/dist/Gmail.jad), [JAR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/woodie/gmail/master/dist/Gmail.jad)
